##How to write test cases

We have given 2 sample test cases. One for testing if bounded buffer is empty and one for testing append and remove function.

To write your own test cases, follow the template given in tests.cpp.

Basic assertions include:

ASSERT_TRUE(condition);	//fatal
EXPECT_TRUE(condition); //nonfatal
ASSERT_FALSE(condition);	
EXPECT_FALSE(condition);
ASSERT_EQ(val1,val2);
EXPECT_EQ(val1,val2);
